## Installation:
1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ESP8266-GasGuard.git
    ```
2. **Open the Project:**
    Open the `ESP8266-GasGuard` folder in the Arduino IDE.
3. **Install Required Libraries:**
    Ensure you have the following libraries installed in the Arduino IDE:
    - `ESP8266WiFi`
    - `LiquidCrystal_I2C`
4. **Upload the Code:**
    Connect your ESP8266 to your computer and upload the `ESP8266_GasGuard.ino` file to the microcontroller.

## Usage:
1. **Assemble the Circuit:**
    Follow the circuit diagram to assemble your gas detector.
2. **Power Up:**
    Connect the power supply to your ESP8266.
3. **Monitor Gas Levels:**
    The LCD will display real-time gas levels. The buzzer will sound, and the Alarm LED will light up if gas concentrations exceed safe levels.
